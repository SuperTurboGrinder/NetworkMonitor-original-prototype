# NtwkMonitor.ButtonExtension

Chrome browser extension that works with [NtwkMonitor](https://github.com/SuperTurboGrinder)

## Usage

Not as straightforward as the program itself. You have to decide what
to do with it yourself. impl.js contains function use_button_list
that you have to implement by returning from it the elements you want
to be used as buttons for opening services for specific nodes.
It contains template implementation and comments for basic solution.

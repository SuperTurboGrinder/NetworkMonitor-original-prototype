For V2
1) authorization for for app and api
2) api for creating different networks and
switching between them
3) each network can be devided on named subsets
containing groups of nodes
4) electron app with html5 webview for app
(to be able to host and update app on remote server
without rebuilding client and have stable running
browser without reloading and unloading tabs)
5) working caching on client with sorting and subsets
(observable for input,
map to -> cached observable for cached input,
map to -> cached observables for different sorting
map to -> cached observables for subsets)
6) real time timed checks with chart
(can be set to subset in configuration)
7) editor for networks and subsets
8) configuring default network, subset and other values
9) skip children if can't ping current node
(make ping cache into a tree,
make checks for every level before going to the next,
on failed ping propagating unreachable status
down the tree (and skipping if scheduled))
